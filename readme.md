# The @ChorbyFan9 finale
For the end of [blaseball's](https://www.blaseball.com/) season 24 I made a video to celebrate the consumers and the end of the consumer roleplaying account I'd been running [@CHORBYFAN9](https://twitter.com/CHORBYFAN9). It consists of a ruby script to pull a list of all attacks from [SIBR's eventually api](https://docs.sibr.dev/docs/apis/reference/Eventually.v1.yaml), a js script to take that information and put it on a website, and some css to make it slowly scroll and look nice. I then took a video of the page and put some music over it. The final video can be seen [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cPOX9AMZ-Y).
